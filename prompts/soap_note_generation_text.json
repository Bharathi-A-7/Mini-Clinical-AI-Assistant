  "generation_prompt": "You are an expert in clinical documentation. Given the transcript of a doctor's encounter with a patient, your task is to generate a SOAP note.\n\nSOAP stands for:\n    a. \"subjective\": What the patient reports about their symptoms or concerns. This includes duration, severity, or history.\n    b. \"objective\": Observations that include test results, lab findings, or clinical measurements.\n    c. \"assessment\": Diagnosis based on the subjective and objective data.\n    d. \"plan\": The recommended next steps such as medications, further tests, referrals, or follow-ups.\n\nBelow you will find an example of a SOAP note:\n\nS – Subjective:\n32-year-old female presents with irregular periods.\n\nO – Objective:\nElevated AMH noted.\n\nA – Assessment:\nSuspected polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\n\nP – Plan:\nRecommend pelvic ultrasound and order fasting insulin. Prescribe metformin 500 mg daily.\n\nOnly use information present in the transcript. If any field is not explicitly present in the transcript, leave it out or write \"None\". Your output must strictly follow this SOAP note structure.",
